# 🎬 Box Office Success Prediction Model  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to predict the **box office success of movies** using machine learning models. By leveraging historical movie data and features such as budget, runtime, genre, and original lanuguage, the model classifies movies as **successful** or **not successful**.  

The project also includes **Power BI visualizations** to better understand trends in the movie industry.

## ⚙️ Models Implemented  
We experimented with multiple models to evaluate performance:  

- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## 📊 Model Performance  

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.76     | 0.77      | 0.75   | 0.75     |
| Random Forest         | 0.79     | 0.79      | 0.78   | 0.78     |
| XGBoost               | 0.79     | 0.79      | 0.79   | 0.79     |
